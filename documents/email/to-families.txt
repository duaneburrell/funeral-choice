Email Alert: To Families
Dear Mr./Mrs., [just a question, but can the system know the contact name and add it to the individual emails that get sent out?]
We are humbled that you have trusted FuneralSave.com to help you make the arrangements that best fit your budget and honor the life of your loved-one.
We are pleased to let you know that we have found Funeral Homes willing to provide the services you requested in and around the area indicated the memorial ceremony was to take place.
Please login to your profile on the FuneralSave.com website to review details of the funeral homes’ response. Once you’ve logged in to the system then click…. to begin reviewing responses submitted.
After you have reviewed all the responses and made your preferred selection, here is what you can expect:
· A detailed view of the Funeral Home profile including contact info
· Release of Remains form will be made available in your profile
· The Funeral Home will contact right away
· Confirmation that remains have been recieved
· Piece of mind
 
Now that the arrangements are almost finished, you can rejoin your family and begin the healing process. It may also a good time to consider other symbols of love and embellishments for your loved one. [in future will want a link here to take them to but flowers and keepsakes.]
